# LockBot
An Arduino based smart lock system with only one button as input.

Many smart lock systems found in the market, requires complex mechanism and expensive input devices like RFID, camera, fingerprint sensor, keypad, etc. 
In this workshop we will learn how to built a smart lock system with only one button as input. While it is simple and easy to build, combined with some Robotics principles, this smart lock is secure and strong enough for most of our daily needs. 

Inspired by Morse Code by Samuel Morse (1841), user must enter the secret code consists of several short and long presses in particular sequence. Upon successful attempt, the microcontroller will turn a servo motor that will move the latch to unlock a door.
